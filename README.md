# FlightsAPI

## Purpose
The project represents an API that should aggregate information about available flights from 2 sources. In addition it should give the client an opportunity to book the selected flight offer.
## Stack
.NET 8, PostgreSQL
## Sources

## Plans
* Write Swagger API documentation  
* Add more tests including functional  
* Implement request caching  
* Add authentication and authorization  
* Create simple web app 
* Containerization of API, application and database with Docker
